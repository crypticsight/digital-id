## Hello World!

Cryptic here, this repository is for my new friends. Hope you all will benefit from it. I will try to include DOCUMENTATION and enough comments in my code and if you would like to contribute; please do the same. It is good practice to always use comments
in the code that you are writing. For one, it makes it easy for you to remember what is taking place. And lastly, it makes your code easier for others to read and understand and offer assistance if needed.
